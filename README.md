This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It exists to debug the `useDocumentDataOnce` hook in the [failurebase library](https://github.com/failurebase/failurebase), which, in some cases doesn't accept the incoming CollectionReference as a valid argument because it fails the instanceof check.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
